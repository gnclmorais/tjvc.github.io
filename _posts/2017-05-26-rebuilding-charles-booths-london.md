I spent a large part of last year working on [Charles Booth's London](https://booth.lse.ac.uk). The site provides access to digitised content from a nineteenth-century study of poverty in London, including an interactive map of the city.

Back in January, I published [a write-up of the technical work involved](https://medium.com/@tjvc/re-building-charles-booths-london-f042ed23a32a) on Medium.
